The European experience illustrates how difficult the road to real democracy is.

We live today in a world of globalized and expanding democracy due to the profound changes set in train by the Industrial Revolution. It set off explosive economic growth that dramatically changed the nature of societies by mobilizing new classes of people—the bourgeoisie or middle class, and the new industrial working class. As they became self-conscious as groups with common interests, they started to organize themselves politically and demanded the right to participate in the political system. Expansion of the franchise was usually a matter of grassroots mobilization of these newly emerging classes, which often led to violence. But in other cases it was the older elite groups that promoted democratic rights as a means of improving their own relative political fortunes. The timing of the spread of democracy in different countries therefore depended on the changing relative positions of the middle class, the working class, landowning elites, and the peasantry. Where the old agrarian order was built around large landowners dependent on servile labor, a peaceful transition to democracy became particularly difficult. But in almost all cases the rise and growth of middle-class groups was critical to the spread of democracy.

By the end of that century, Europe saw an enormous shift as peasants left the countryside, cities expanded, and an industrial working class was formed.1 The German social theorist Ferdinand Tönnies described this as the shift from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft, or what is typically translated in English as “community” and “society.”2 Other nineteenth-century theorists invented new dichotomies to describe the transition from the one form of society to the other, including Max Weber’s distinction between traditional and charismatic to legal/rational authority, Émile Durkheim’s opposition of mechanical and organic solidarity, and Henry Maine’s move from status to contract.3<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h[_W]<br>Interesting; so in China, the real force that is going to turn the society is NOT us who had privileged to be born, educated and grow in cities (we were part of the early birds, but were not the main stream at all), but those who we called 'farmer immigrants' whom we sort of disdained (house maidens, workers who decorate the house, install air-conditions, or the deliverers)!h///"},{"idx":"2e66c221-e8e8-443c-b1fc-e97de5f73d23","name":"Social mobilization happening in Asian and Africa today","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Each of these schema sought to explicate the shift from Gemeinschaft—the close-knit village where everyone knows each other and identities are fixed—to Gesellschaft, the big city with its diversity and anonymity.

In the anonymous city, people become more mobile, live in more diverse and pluralistic societies, and have fluid identities that are no longer determined by the customs of the village, tribe, or family. These novel social relationships give rise, as we will see, to new forms of identity like nationalism, or to new forms of universalistic religious affiliation. It is social mobilization that lays the ground for changes in political institutions.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h[_L]<br>give rise to .h///"},{"idx":"b3472720-5e74-4c2c-abce-8558890e6d28","name":"Evolution in ideas of legitimacy","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  In addition to economic growth and social mobilization, there is an evolution in ideas concerning legitimacy. Legitimacy represents a broadly shared perception that certain social arrangements are just. Ideas regarding legitimacy evolve over time.

When it was next called in 1789, however, the intellectual conditions in France were hugely different, with the blossoming of the Enlightenment and the spread of the ideas of the Rights of Man. This shift, needless to say, was one reason why the second Estates-General paved the way for the French Revolution. Similarly, there was a critical change in the thinking of English political actors during the seventeenth century: at the start, they spoke about defending the rights of Englishmen, that is, feudal rights inherited from time immemorial; a hundred years later, under the influence of writers like Hobbes and Locke, they demanded their natural rights as human beings. This made a huge difference in the kind of regime that would be created there, and in North America.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"ef14c138-4b8a-4110-9749-fa749351b417","name":"A new concept of universality that differs from the religious one","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  A historian of a Marxist bent might say that the adoption of these new ideas about universal rights reflected the rise of the bourgeoisie in both France and England, and that they constituted a superstructure masking economic interest. Karl Marx himself famously said that religion was the “opiate of the people.” But the bourgeoisie could have made a case for itself on the basis of the special privileges of the old feudal order, rather than a doctrine that opened the door to universal human equality. The fact that it chose to justify itself in these terms hearkened back to yet other ideas of, alternatively, Christian universalism and the evolving doctrines of modern natural science. One wonders, moreover, what the history of the twentieth century would have looked like without Marx. There were of course many Socialist thinkers before and after him, reflecting the interests of the emerging working class. But none were able to analyze the conditions of early industrialization so brilliantly, link them to a larger Hegelian theory of history, and explain in self-professed “scientific” terms the necessity of the ultimate victory of the proletariat. From the pen of Marx emerged a new secular ideology that became, in the hands of leaders like Lenin and Mao, a substitute for religion that succeeded in mobilizing millions of people and materially changing the course of history.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"f0a535ce-878a-4afc-97d8-27025945ff56","name":"Economic growth, social mobility, and idea of

Prior to that moment, which corresponds to the historical period covered in the first volume of this book, much of the world lived under the conditions described by the English writer Thomas Malthus, whose 1798 Essay on the Principle of Population painted a gloomy picture in which population growth would outstrip economic resources in the long run. Figure 2 shows an estimate of per capita income over an eight-hundred-year period in England, where the Industrial Revolution started. The hockey-stick shape of the curve, and the sudden transition to a much higher rate of growth, reflects the fact that the later period saw continual year-on-year increases in productivity that vastly outstripped the rate of population growth. While we might speculate that this blessed interval of rapid growth may someday still be overwhelmed by population increase and by absolute limits to available resources, we are nonetheless fortunately still living in a post-Malthusian world.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"2c5fc5cd-0a9d-4438-8311-68cbe70d8e11","name":"Industrial revolution facilitated by political and innstitutional factors","NodeDescription":"<p>///t</p><p>What caused this sudden burst of economic growth? The Industrial Revolution had been preceded by a commercial revolution starting in the sixteenth century that vastly expanded the volume of trade both within Europe and across the Atlantic. This expansion, in turn, was driven by a host of political and institutional factors: the establishment of secure property rights, the rise of modern states, the invention of double-entry bookkeeping and the modern corporation, and new technologies of communications and transportation. The Industrial Revolution in turn rested on the systematic application of the scientific method and its incorporation into an institutional structure of universities and research organizations, which could then be translated into technological innovations.4</p><p><img

The third chapter of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations is titled “The Division of Labor is Limited by the Extent of the Market.” Smith began the book with his famous description of a pin factory. Instead of a single craftsman pulling, cutting, and sharpening individual pins, each task is given to a specialized worker, which vastly increases the factory’s productivity. But there would be no incentive to increase productivity in this fashion, Smith asserts, if a sufficiently large market did not exist. Smith thus argues that the expanding division of labor is stimulated in turn by improvements in transportation and communication that increase the size of markets. The commercial revolution of Smith’s day seeded the Industrial Revolution that would soon unfold.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"7e019faf-1559-48c1-83c2-099bb47db352","name":"specialization renounced by Marx and Engels","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  The expanding division of labor then becomes a central focus for subsequent thinkers, beginning with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who in The Communist Manifesto talk about formerly proud craftsmen being reduced to robotic cogs in a huge industrial machine. Unlike Smith, they see specialization and the division of labor as an evil that alienates workers from their true beings. One gets a sense of how different this modern world was from the agrarian one that preceded it from the following passage written in 1848 just as the Industrial Revolution was shifting into high gear in England:<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"85a641a6-445e-4f9d-a7a3-ce037c5b7efb","name":"Old relations from home are useless for the bourgeois  ","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all newly-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"0da48c62-031b-4e45-a392-36c48bf2154b","name":"Innovations in europe that dwarf silicon valley","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Silicon Valley thinks that it invented “disruptive innovation,” but in fact the rate of social change across Europe and America was if anything higher at the time that Marx wrote than it is in the early twenty-first century.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"370b8956-7684-431d-9a14-f10ba28e9832","name":"Social mobilization caused demand for participation in politics","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Social mobilization creates political change by creating new groups that demand participation in the political system. Throughout industrializing Europe and America in the late nineteenth century, workers began to join together in trade unions and pushed for higher wages, as well as better and safer working conditions. They agitated for the right to speak out publicly, to organize, and to vote. Workers also began to support new political parties, which in turn started to win elections under banners like the British Labour Party and the German Social Democratic Party. In places without elections, such as Russia, they began joining underground Communist parties.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"75b11111-9ce4-4508-b0a6-ed51bb09b15d","name":"Technolical enabled sharing of practice","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Spreading communications and transportation technologies fostered another important change that occurred in this period: the appearance of an early form of globalization that allowed ideas to spread across political boundaries in ways they had not done previously. The development of political institutions before 1800 took place largely within the context of single societies, even though some of those societies were rather large. For example, the Chinese introduction of merit-based bureaucracy in the third century B.C. had virtually no impact on the contemporaneous Greek and Roman worlds. While early Arab state builders could look to neighboring Persian or Byzantine models, they did not seek to emulate the feudal institutions of contemporary Europe, much less those of the Indians or Chinese.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"bbd7b107-9954-4c11-bf10-ca05ed9f39f6","name":"Globalization started by the Mongols, and the Est","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  The beginnings of a world system were laid first by the Mongols, who carried both trade and diseases all the way from China to Europe and the Middle East, and then by the Arabs who extended their networks from Europe to Southeast Asia. It was subsequently the Europeans who opened up trade with both the Americas and South and East Asia. For those who think that globalization is a unique feature of the early twenty-first-century world, consider the following passage from The Communist     Manifesto: “The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe … The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country … All old-established national industries have been destroyed … by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe.”<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"127e5aad-b192-41ed-8d5a-f45f1e3cf3b7","name":"Technology also enabled spread of ideology","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  What was true of commodities was also true of ideas concerning political and economic institutions: if something seemed to work in one part of the world, it was rapidly copied in another. For example, Adam Smith’s ideas about the power of markets circulated widely throughout Europe and traveled all the way to Latin America where Spanish Bourbon reformers relaxed earlier mercantilist restrictions on trade.

Huntington pointed to the “gap” that emerged between the expectations of newly mobilized populations and their government’s ability or willingness to accommodate their participation in politics.

He was right that instability reflected a lack of institutions. This is true almost by definition, since institutions are rules that organize behavior. But the instability and violence he observed in the 1950s and ’60s was not necessarily the result of modernization upsetting otherwise stable traditional societies. His view that such societies were stable is misleading: most developing countries had been parts of colonial empires before the period in which he wrote, where authority was imposed externally. We have little reliable data, quantitative or otherwise, on general levels of conflict in, say, sub-Saharan Africa before the colonialists’ arrival. Many of the new countries in the developing world that emerged in this period, like Nigeria and the Belgian Congo/Zaire, had never existed as independent polities previously and therefore had no traditional institutions to speak of at a national level. It is therefore not surprising that they fell into conflict shortly after independence.

Many failing or fragile states are thus caught in a low-level trap whereby poor institutions fail to control violence, which produces poverty, which further weakens the ability of the government to govern. While many people believe that ethnicity is a cause of conflict when observing the Balkans, South Asia, Africa, and other places in the aftermath of the cold war, William Easterly shows that when one controls for the strength of institutions, any link between ethnic diversity and conflict disappears. James Fearon and David Laitin similarly show that higher levels of ethnic or religious diversity were not more likely to cause conflict when controlling for level of per capita income.

This process will continue until nonelites succeed in mobilizing politically to reverse it or otherwise protect themselves. In some cases a reaction takes the form of violent revolution, as in the French and Bolshevik Revolutions; in others it can take the form of populist policies of redistribution as in Argentina under Juan Perón, or Venezuela under Hugo Chávez. Ideally, constraints on the power of elites should be exercised through democratic control of the state, where the state’s policies reflect a broad consensus on the part of the population as to what constitutes a fair distribution of the resources at the state’s disposal. As in the case of redistribution, the trick is to prevent the overrepresentation of elites without punishing them for their ability to generate wealth.</p><p> t/// </p><p> ///h </p><p>[_Q]</p><p>What would be the example of \"prevent the overrepresentation of elites without punishing them for their ability to generate wealth\" ?</p><p> h///</p>","custparents":[{"idx":"MY6cdef678-86a6-4a72-b050-79dc97a227cb"}]}]},{"idx":"41c95123-8e04-4199-9646-b891a53f440e","name":"Scope of the state","NodeDescription":"<p>///t </p><p> There is today a wide range of views on the appropriate scope of the state, ranging from those who believe it should provide only the most basic of public goods, to those who think it should actively shape the nature of society and engage in substantial redistribution. As noted, all modern liberal democracies engage in some degree of redistribution, but the extent of state intervention varies significantly from the social democracies of Scandinavia to the more classically liberal United States. Figure 3 shows a spectrum of state functions from minimal to activist in which modern governments can engage.</p><p><img

Any given function, from fighting fires to providing health services to undertaking industrial policy, can be done better or worse depending on the quality of the state bureaucracy charged with performing that function. Governments are collections of complex organizations; how well they perform depends on how they are organized and the resources, human and material, at their disposal. In evaluating states, then, there are two axes of importance, a horizontal axis defining the scope of state functions, and a vertical axis defining the capacity of the state to undertake a given function (see Figure 4 below).</p><p><img

Max Weber famously identified a modern state with a set of procedures, the most important of which had to do with the strict functional organization of offices and the selection of bureaucrats based on merit and technical competence rather than patronage.4 Some of Weber’s criteria are not necessarily conditions that we would today accept as necessary for good bureaucratic functioning, such as the office constituting a lifetime career and the need for strict discipline and control through an administrative hierarchy. The idea, however, that bureaucrats should be chosen according to their technical qualifications and promoted on the basis of merit rather than through personal connections is both widely accepted and correlated with positive governance outcomes like low corruption and economic growth.5 Whereas Weber highlighted bureaucratic form, political scientist Bo Rothstein has suggested the use of “impartiality” as a measure of government quality, a normative characteristic that he argues correlates strongly with efficient performance.6 Conversely, one could also assess the quality of government through measures of dysfunction, such as perceived levels of government corruption like Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index.7<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///","custparents":[{"idx":"MYcd450d5d-655f-4a3e-9019-e9553f475dcc"},{"idx":"MYb8bb79e2-73e3-4bfc-a57b-8626a38987e9"}]},{"idx":"84caee16-6560-44a6-8a61-89ecd60eca8e","name":"Rigidity is what people dislike about the government","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Measuring the strength of government through procedures alone is unlikely to capture its real quality, however. Weber’s classic definition assumes that modern government is a rigid, rule-bound institution that is mechanically tasked with carrying out the functions set it by the principal. But in fact procedural rigidity, rather than being a virtue, is at the core of what people dislike about modern government. Weber himself spoke of bureaucratic administration as an “iron cage” in which people were trapped.8<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///","custparents":[{"idx":"MYcd450d5d-655f-4a3e-9019-e9553f475dcc"},{"idx":"MYb8bb79e2-73e3-4bfc-a57b-8626a38987e9"}]},{"idx":"15d96948-54a0-438c-9068-4c9c0981487d","name":"Assessing capacity in making policies","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  An alternative method to a procedural approach is an assessment of the capacity of a government to formulate policies and carry them out, or what Joel Migdal calls the ability of a state to “penetrate” the society over which it presides.9 Capacity, in turn, is defined by a number of factors, including the size of the bureaucracy, the resources at its disposal, and the levels of education and expertise of government officials. Some scholars use the rate at which a government can extract taxes from its population as a capacity measure, the same used to measure scope. The reason for this is that taxes, particularly direct ones like an income tax, are hard to collect and also represent resources at the government’s disposal. However, the ability of an organization to perform its functions is never simply a matter of measurable resources. Organizational culture also matters—the degree to which the individuals who make up the organization can function cooperatively, engender trust, take risks, innovate, and the like. A Weberian bureaucracy defined only by formal procedures may or may not have the intangible qualities necessary to make it function effectively.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///","custparents":[{"idx":"MYcd450d5d-655f-4a3e-9019-e9553f475dcc"},{"idx":"MYb8bb79e2-73e3-4bfc-a57b-8626a38987e9"}]},{"idx":"c7ceea00-1679-48b2-a779-a4c14be4c00c","name":"Assessing the results (teachers, public schools, etc)","NodeDescription":"<p>///t </p><p> A different approach to measuring the quality of government would be to look not at what the government is, but rather at what it does. The purpose of government, after all, is not to follow procedures but to provide the population with basic services including education, defense, public safety, and legal access; an output measure like the degree to which children were being educated by the public school system would be more informative than data about teacher numbers, recruitment, or training. Lant Pritchett, Michael Woolcock, and Matt Andrews have argued that one of the big problems with developing countries’ governments is that they engage in what they term “isomorphic mimicry,” that is, copying the outward forms of developed countries’ governments, while being unable to reproduce the kinds of outputs, like education and health, that the latter achieve.10 Measuring what the government actually does rather than how it does it would avoid this problem.</p><p> t/// </p><p> ///h </p><p>[_W]</p><p>I guess Fukuyama's view on public school was not shared by Ferguson; the latter argued that public schools should give way to private schools (the Great degeneration).</p><p> h///</p>","custparents":[{"idx":"MYcd450d5d-655f-4a3e-9019-e9553f475dcc"},{"idx":"MYb8bb79e2-73e3-4bfc-a57b-8626a38987e9"}]},{"idx":"a612ac3f-6830-4e75-9525-53e1cad0c462","name":"Outcomes measures are hard to get right","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Appealing as output measures are, however, they can be misleading. Good outcomes, like quality public education, are a complex mixture of inputs provided by governments (teachers, curriculum, classrooms, etc.) as well as characteristics of the population being served, including their income, social habits, and culture (that is, the degree to which learning is valued in the home). A classic study of educational outcomes in the United States was the 1966 Coleman Report, whose statistical analysis showed that quality education was much more a reflection of a student’s friends and family than of the inputs being supplied by the government.11 In any event, measuring outcomes is often difficult for the kinds of complex services offered by modern governments. For example, how does one measure the quality of a judicial system? Clearly a gross output measure of the number of cases closed or the number of convictions is meaningless in the absence of qualitative measures of whether the courts were adjudicating cases fairly, or using torture to extract confessions.

The most basic form of autonomy concerns the right to control the government’s own staff and hire personnel based on professional rather than political grounds. But autonomy is important also for implementation, since highly complex or contradictory mandates seldom produce good results. Too much autonomy, on the other hand, can also lead to disaster, either in terms of corruption or bureaucracies that set their own agendas beyond any type of political control.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///","custparents":[{"idx":"MYcd450d5d-655f-4a3e-9019-e9553f475dcc"},{"idx":"MYb8bb79e2-73e3-4bfc-a57b-8626a38987e9"}]}]},{"idx":"MYb2512df5-5ae3-45ec-9eea-9af40d6a1d75","name":"Comprehensive measures","custparents":[{"idx":"7f329392-6f69-4833-919d-ca7a23516c36"}],"children":[{"idx":"e28fe4e8-76a0-4cbc-aa5d-218bc95af54b","name":"A comprehensive measure would be optimal but difficult","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Good procedures, capacity, outputs, and bureaucratic autonomy are thus all possible ways of defining where a state lies on the vertical axis of Figure 4. It would be nice if there were scholarly agreement on a standardized way of measuring state quality, but no such measure exists. In recent years, a number of economists have tried to devise quantitative measures of the quality of government, with varying success. Comprehensive comparison is made more difficult by the fact that the quality of government within each country varies tremendously depending on region, function, and level (national, state, or local).<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///","custparents":[{"idx":"MYb2512df5-5ae3-45ec-9eea-9af40d6a1d75"}]},{"idx":"9dbcc106-3de5-4954-a4d2-d71acad3e99f","name":"The world bank governance index (WGI) ","NodeDescription":"<p>///t</p><p>Despite these challenges, one commonly used cross-national measure of government performance is the World Bank Institute’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), which has been produced annually since the early 2000s. These indicators measure six dimensions of governance for a wide range of countries (voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption). Figure 5 extracts two of these dimensions, control of corruption and government effectiveness, for a selected group of developed and less developed countries, ranked in order of their scores on the

The measures also fail to capture the variance in the quality of government that exists within each country; the U.S. Marine Corps is very different from a local police force in rural Louisiana, just as the quality of education differs greatly between Shanghai and a poor county in the interior of China. Nonetheless, these indicators broadly suggest the tremendous degree of variance in the quality of government that exists across the world, and the fact that government effectiveness and level of corruption are correlated. As any number of studies have indicated, the quality of government correlates very strongly with a country’s degree of economic development.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///","custparents":[{"idx":"MYb2512df5-5ae3-45ec-9eea-9af40d6a1d75"}]}]},{"idx":"701d5917-a34b-4569-adb3-0c6965e17a1d","name":"Nations on the state scope/strength matrix","NodeDescription":"<p>///t </p><p> We can fill in the two-dimensional matrix of state scope versus state strength from Figure 4 with some real data, using tax revenues as a percentage of GDP as a proxy for scope and the World Bank government effectiveness indicator as a proxy for strength (see Figure 6). Developed countries vary considerably in the size of their governments, but we see that they all lie in the upper portion of the matrix. That is, you can become a high-income country with a large state—Denmark, the Netherlands—or with a relatively small one—Singapore, the United States. But no country can get rich without an effective government. There are a number of emerging market countries, such as China, India, and Russia, that are at approximately the midpoint of the vertical axis;12 the poor countries in the sample are all nearer the bottom, and the weakest states are closer to zero.</p><p><img

I will compare five cases: Prussia/Germany, Greece, Italy, Britain, and the United States. Prussia/Germany and Greece and Italy stand as bookends within the contemporary European Union.

A vigorous king like Frederick the Great could intimidate the bureaucracy and make it subservient to his wishes. His famous political testament echoed the patrimonial view of France’s Louis XIV, “L’État, c’est moi.”27 But under his less forceful successors Frederick William II (1786–1797) and Frederick William III (1797–1840), the balance of influence shifted decisively in favor of the bureaucracy. Earlier kings had turned the bureaucracy into a powerful and cohesive status group; it was this internal solidarity that gave it a high degree of institutional autonomy. These officials increasingly saw themselves not as servants of the Hohenzollern dynasty but rather as servants of the Prussian state, a state whose interests transcended the fate of any particular occupant of the throne. This esprit de corps increased when the bureaucracy was opened after 1806 to ambitious, talented, and well-educated men from the bourgeoisie. Thus it was that one observer could say in 1799 that “far from being an unlimited monarchy,” the Prussian state was an aristocracy that “rules the country in an undisguised form as a bureaucracy.”28 For this reason, Hegel in The Philosophy of Right saw the bureaucracy as the embodiment of a “universal class” that represented the whole community, as opposed to civil society, whose interests were necessarily partial and self-directed.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"a052acc7-e38d-4a55-aac8-3ff0fdc49c4a","name":"An agent, not a principal","NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  All effective institutions need to have a high degree of autonomy.

Economists understand this problem in principal-agent terms. Bureaucracies are supposed to be agents that do not have their own goals; those goals are set by the principal for whom they work. In a monarchical state, that principal is the king or ruling dynasty; in a democracy, it is the sovereign people who rule through their elected representatives. In a well-functioning political system, the agent should have enough autonomy to do its job well, but should also remain ultimately accountable to the principal.

This high degree of autonomy made the military an increasing driver of German foreign policy, or, as historian Gordon Craig puts it, a “state within the state.” The General Staff’s General Alfred von Waldersee began arguing at the time of the Bulgarian Crisis of 1887–1888 that war with Russia in support of Austria’s interests in the Balkans was inevitable, and he pressed for preventive war. Bismarck, who wisely understood that the object of Germany’s foreign policy should be to prevent emergence of a hostile anti-German coalition, was able to contain this threat, saying memorably that preventive war was like committing suicide out of fear of death. But his weaker successors failed to control the military’s political influence. The General Staff under Generals Alfred von Schlieffen and Helmuth von Moltke (the Younger) drew up plans for a two-front war against France and Russia, urged an aggressive stance during the Moroccan crisis of 1905 (which drove Britain and France closer together), and pressed to support their Austrian ally in the lead-up to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in July 1914. The military’s belief that a two-front war was inevitable became a self-fulfilling prophecy as the emperor was told he had no choice but to attack France on the army’s timetable in response to events in the Balkans.

Political scientist Edward Banfield, in his ethnographic account of a small, impoverished town in Basilicata, posits the concept of “amoral familism,” whose code he describes as “Maximize the material, short-run advantage of the nuclear family; assume that all others will do likewise.” Cooperation within the immediate family came at the expense of a broader capacity to trust strangers: “any advantage that may be given to another is necessarily at the expense of one’s own family.

As I argued in Volume 1, the development of centralized state authority is a necessary condition for modern government, but it tells you little about the degree of political freedom that will exist in a given society. As Europe exited feudalism, the key to the eventual emergence of accountable institutions was the balance that existed between the monarch (or state) and the other elite power holders in the society. Where the monarch succeeded in co-opting the aristocracy and upper bourgeoisie, as in France and Spain, weak absolutism emerged; where the monarch and aristocracy joined hands against the peasantry, as in Prussia and Russia, there was strong absolutism; where the aristocracy was stronger than the monarchy, as in Hungary and Poland, there was local tyranny and national weakness. Only in England were the state and aristocratic elites relatively balanced; constitutional government arose out of the fact that neither one could prevail over the other. The English state often threw its weight into the balance in favor of nonelites against the aristocracy, not out of egalitarian ideology but because it wanted to clip the wings of a rival for power.

Opportunities to do so expanded rapidly with the division of communal lands after the abolition of feudalism by Napoleon (which happened later in Sicily than in the continental Mezzogiorno), and the division of church lands after 1860. This led to a large number of social conflicts over land among different social classes. Thus the interests of the northern middle class were very much aligned with the project of creating a new and modern state, while the southern middle class was absorbed into the traditional oligarchy. The peasantry was deprived of a potential ally and relegated to an increasingly impoverished and marginalized state.

One theory of the Mafia’s origins is that the mafiosi were originally gabelloti, richer tenants who exploited their role between landlords and poor peasants to extort rents from both.16 Diego Gambetta, however, presents an elegant economic theory of the Mafia’s origins: mafiosi are private entrepreneurs whose function is to provide protection of individual property rights in a society in which the state fails to perform this basic service. That is, if one party to a private transaction is cheated by the other, he would normally take his partner to court in a well-ordered rule-of-law society. But where the state is corrupt, unreliable, or perhaps altogether absent, one must turn instead to a private provider of protection and task him to threaten to break the legs of the other party if he doesn’t pay up. By this account, the Mafia is simply a private organization providing a needed service that is normally performed by the state—that is, use of the threat of violence (and sometimes actual violence) to enforce property rights. Gambetta shows that the Mafia arose precisely in those parts of southern Italy where there was economic conflict over land, mobile wealth and a high volume of transactions, and political discord in connection with the changes taking place in the nature of the Italian state after 1860.17<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"75b28b3c-79d2-460f-a4c5-a6d72251eb32","name":338,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  There are, of course, good reasons why the use of violence to protect property rights should be a monopoly of a legitimate state.

Private protection also easily evolves into other illegal rackets, such as prostitution and drug trafficking. The Mafia, as Gambetta argues, thrives in a low-trust society like that of Sicily because it can provide credible protection services in the short run.

This culminated in the assassination in 1992 of Falcone, his wife, and his bodyguards, and of Borsellino shortly thereafter.31 With the killing of police chief Alberto dalla Chiesa, prosecutor Gaetano Costa, and magistrate Rocco Chinnici, public opinion was gradually mobilized in support of anticorruption efforts. With the cold war no longer serving as a backstop to corrupt but conservative politicians, the revelations that came out of Tangentopoli and other investigations finally brought down Prime Minister Andreotti and the Christian Democratic Party as a whole.

The very term “civil service” originated in India as a means of distinguishing the East India Company’s civilian employees from its military ones.4 The men who volunteered for the ICS were not the cream of British society; working conditions and long years away from home made it a haven for dropouts, adventurers, and men who had failed in occupations at home. In the words of Adam Smith, a thousand pounds of company stock gave a “share … not in the plunder, yet in the appointment of the plunderers of India.” A directorship of the company paid a very small salary but entailed enormous benefits in a director’s ability to dispense jobs and moneymaking opportunities to friends, relatives, and clients.5<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"a0215c63-1db3-4521-b0df-cc9af1a65196","name":376,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  The work of the ICS was, nonetheless, varied and demanding, and required a broad range of administrative skills.

In the debate over the Government of India Act of 1833 that would renew the company’s charter, Thomas Babington Macaulay (later Lord Macaulay) made an impassioned argument for open competition and educational qualifications as the basis for service in India.

Up through the 1860s, only one out of eight British citizens could vote.20 Expansion of the franchise to include most householders had to await the 1867 and 1884 reforms, after which some 40 percent of British adult males, including lodgers, tenants, domestic servants, soldiers, and sailors, were still not permitted to vote.

On American soil these old institutions became entrenched and were eventually written into the American Constitution, a fragment of the old society frozen in time.2 Those Tudor characteristics included the Common Law as a source of authority, one higher than that of the executive, with a correspondingly strong role for courts in governance; a tradition of local self-rule; sovereignty divided among a host of bodies, rather than being concentrated in a centralized state; government with divided powers instead of divided functions, such that, for example, the judiciary exercised not just judicial but also quasi-legislative functions; and reliance on a popular militia rather than a standing army.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"e0bcafaa-cf77-4001-9704-92e5e47ab99c","name":399,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Huntington argued that after the Tudor period, England went on to develop the concept of a unified sovereignty and a centralized state in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The local governing bodies of medieval England evolved into parliamentary districts, with authority increasingly centralized in London; in the years following the Glorious Revolution, Parliament came to be understood as the sole source of sovereignty. While the Common Law remained sacrosanct, England never developed a theory or practice of judicial review by which the courts could invalidate an act of Parliament. Americans, by contrast, clung to Tudor institutions: “Political modernization in America has thus been strangely attenuated and incomplete.

As an area of new settlement (at least for Europeans), North America appeared as a land of equal opportunity where one’s station in life reflected one’s own work and talents. With few inherited inequalities, there was no demand for a strong state that would redistribute wealth, but rather widespread belief in a Lockean liberalism where individuals were free to help themselves.

What it did not inherit was the strong central state, which in England had always incipiently existed since the Norman Conquest and that had evolved into a powerful unified sovereignty by the beginning of the eighteenth century. The very struggle for independence from Britain amplified the American antistatist tendency and ensured that a host of constraints on government power would be enshrined in the new nation’s Constitution in the form of multiple checks and balances.

In the period immediately following ratification of the Constitution in 1789, the national public service at its upper levels has been described as a “Government by Gentlemen” and it did not look too different in certain respects from the one that existed in early-nineteenth-century Britain.8 One might also label it government by the friends of George Washington, since the republic’s first president chose men like himself who he felt had good qualifications and a dedication to public service.9 Under John Adams, 70 percent, and under Jefferson, 60 percent of high-ranking officials had fathers who came from the landed gentry, merchant, or professional classes.10 Many people today marvel at the quality of political leadership at the time of America’s founding, the sophistication of the discourse revealed in the Federalist Papers, and the ability to think about institutions in a long-term perspective. At least part of the reason for this strong leadership was that America at the time was not a full democracy but rather a highly elitist society, many of whose leaders were graduates of Harvard and Yale.

Within this group of players were a number of diverse interests. Some, like the railroads, found it perfectly easy to make use of the patronage system to buy off state legislatures and protect their interests. By contrast, supporters of reform tended to be urban merchants and manufacturers whose interests were hurt more by the poor quality of government services that the old system produced. “Reformers harped on reports of post offices where bags of undelivered mail lay forgotten in locked rooms, and they lectured local chambers of commerce about customhouses in Prussia and Britain that were four and five times more cost efficient per volume of work done.”16 City merchants wanted clean streets, public transportation, and police and fire protection, all of which were jeopardized by party control of municipal government. One of the big controversies leading up to the Pendleton Act was an investigation of the New York Custom House through which a large volume of trade passed and from which the U.S. government derived nearly 50 percent of all its revenues. The Custom House was under the control of Republican boss Roscoe Conkling and a prime source of patronage. Conkling’s ultimate defeat reflected a power struggle between the Stalwart and Half-Breed factions of the Republican Party, and the final outcome—merit-based recruitment into the Custom House—suited the interests of New York’s business community.17<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"1a44809a-35b4-482e-98e5-5f9537d638be","name":454,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  A second group in favor of reform was the stratum of middle-class professionals that emerged by the late nineteenth century.

In Stephen Skowronek’s words, they represented the “key link between America’s old patrician elite and its new professional sector. Their roots lay in established American families and high New England culture.”24 This new middle-class elite sought reforms against the interests of a political class that had succeeded in mobilizing the vast mass of nonelite voters into the patronage system. The reformers tended to be upper-crust Protestants resentful of the barely literate Catholics and Jews who were flooding into the country, unfamiliar with American values and practices. They were trying, in a certain sense, to recoup the social status their predecessors had held in the period before the onset of Jacksonian populism. They saw themselves differently, of course, as leaders of modernization in a backward society.25 They bitterly resented the fact that less-educated politicians held real political power and that they did not; their education and technical knowledge got little respect from the existing political class.

But clientelistic systems do not exist because the officials staffing them, or the politicians who stand behind them, somehow don’t understand how to organize an efficient agency. Clientelism exists because incumbents benefit from the system, either as political bosses who get access to power and resources, or as their clients who get jobs and perks. Dislodging them requires more than the formal reorganization of the government.

The problem in assembling a reform coalition is that the existing clientelistic politicians will also try to recruit these groups to their cause. In the United States, many of the railroads—exemplars of industrial modernity—learned to play the corrupt patronage game. This meant that the reform coalition had to include older, economically less modern groups like small farmers, and shippers whose interests were hurt by the railroads.

In undeveloped areas railroads were the determining factor in exactly where settlement would occur … Stories are rife concerning towns which no longer exist because they could not attract a railroad, without which products could not get to market.”1 As a result, railroads were built at a furious pace; the ton-miles carried by the thirteen largest lines rose 600 percent between 1865 and 1880, and mileage doubled just between the years 1870 and 1876.2<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"63994a10-b5f8-4e57-accc-7a2b1463140c","name":482,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Unlike in Europe, where the railroads were either developed by governments or were placed early on under strict government supervision, the railroads in the United States were almost entirely products of the free market.

Competition was fiercest among the large trunk lines; these companies often overbuilt rail mileage and engaged in ruinous rate wars. There were, for example, twenty competitive routes between St. Louis and Atlanta in the 1880s.3 Companies that went bankrupt could often undermine healthy ones (as in today’s airline industry) by continuing to operate in receivership while lowering their costs. In response to steadily falling revenues, the railroads tried to create “pools” or cartels that would limit price competition, but these were often broken by opportunistic players operating in cooperation with shippers. On smaller feeder lines, by contrast, a single railroad often held a monopoly and could raise rates on hapless farmers and shippers at will. The lines were tempted to give volume discounts to large shippers sending goods over long distances, due to economies of scale; this angered smaller local producers and shippers, who were at a competitive disadvantage. There were moreover serious and often violent conflicts between railway owners and their workers.4 In all of these cases, the different economic players turned to their elected representatives to defend their interests politically.

The negative consequences of this shift for the railroads became evident only by World War I, when the needs of wartime mobilization dramatically increased demand for rail services. The capacity of the American railway system was severely inadequate, reflecting the underinvestment that had occurred by railroads increasingly unable to recover costs due to regulatory limitations on rates. As German submarines intercepted American shipping to Europe, goods piled up in American ports and the ICC proved unable to unsnarl the traffic. As a result, President Wilson nationalized the entire railroad system in December 1917, adjusted rates and wages, and had the government run the railroads directly until they were returned to private control in the Esch-Cummins Act of 1920.15<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"b0c9acab-ed85-43e2-89e5-c5ab2aa8d60f","name":494,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Stephen Skowronek celebrates the 1920 Transportation Act as a milestone in which “national administrative authority superseded the limits of courts and parties and in the process transformed the organizational, procedural, and intellectual landscape of American government.”16 He is certainly correct that the nation’s first national regulator set a precedent for the growth of the powers of the federal government in the twentieth century. But the ICC’s economic legacy was far more mixed. The commission structure that balanced party appointees prevented it from developing sufficient bureaucratic autonomy, and it remained hostage to underlying political interests. Over the following decades, the ICC shifted from having too little power to imposing an excessive regulatory burden. This impeded innovation and new investment in the national rail system. For example, the ICC did not permit the Southern Railway to realize the efficiency gains from its introduction of Big John aluminum hopper cars during the 1960s, making it uncompetitive with barges.17 Railways faced increasing competition from trucking and ships, which were actually subsidized by other government programs, such as the building of the interstate highway system. By the 1970s, American railroads were in the midst of a full-blown crisis, with most railroads in major financial trouble and the Penn Central only the last of thirty-seven eastern carriers forced into bankruptcy.18 In response, the intellectual climate shifted notably by the late 1970s toward a consensus on the need for deregulation of the entire American transportation system.

One of the biggest supporters of Interior Department control of forests was House Speaker Joe Cannon, Republican from Illinois (for whom the current building housing the U.S. House of Representatives is named), whose anticonservationist inclinations were summed up in the words “not one cent for scenery.” Cannon attacked Pinchot as having been “born with a gold spoon in his mouth,” and criticized government scientists for being “industrious to fasten upon the public teat.” Against this background, Pinchot began assembling a coalition of supporters in favor of a bill to shift authority over forests from Interior to Agriculture.25<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"6845cc52-66d1-460a-9d86-bd4e98354f5b","name":508,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  The battle over control of public lands took place in the context of the big changes occurring elsewhere on the political scene.

This had led to the appointment of James S. Wilson as secretary of agriculture, a post in which he would remain for a record sixteen years under three presidents. Wilson was critical in shifting the department from a seed-distribution agency to a forward-looking, science-based organization, not just with respect to the Forest Service but also in areas like agricultural extension services, the regulation of pure foods and drugs, and the like.26 Theodore Roosevelt had become president in 1901 on McKinley’s assassination, and Roosevelt was of course a great outdoorsman who was converted to the cause of conservation by C. Hart Merriam of the Agriculture Department’s Biological Survey and John Muir.

A young GLO agent named Louis Glavis began noting questionable dealings between Ballinger and various Seattle land investors, including payments made to Ballinger after he was named to his office. When Glavis tried to report his findings to the president with the help of two of Pinchot’s Forest Service agents, Taft issued a gag order and allowed Ballinger to fire the whistle-blower.

Now that I’m no longer living under the thumb of my family and friends back in the village, I have a much greater degree of choice over my own life course. “Who am I?” has all of a sudden become a real and pressing question. This shift is experienced as a crisis or trauma and produces a condition that Émile Durkheim labeled anomie, or normlessness. Durkheim saw anomie manifest in higher suicide rates in modernizing societies, but it also finds expression in higher rates of crime and family breakdown that are often associated with rapid social change.8<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"3595e830-4cf2-4d7b-b16d-854bf89bb891","name":542,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  One problem with Gellner’s theory linking nationalism to industrialization and to a linguistically grounded culture is that it fails to explain the emergence of nationalism in nonindustrial societies.

He makes a broader observation that all just enterprises originate in a crime.12 So too with the founding of democracy in the United States. North America was not a land of “new settlement” as is sometimes asserted. It was a territory thinly occupied by indigenous tribal groups who had to be exterminated, moved, or driven off their lands into reservations to make way for the democratic institutions of the settlers. American national identity is based on principles of equality, individual rights, and democracy, but that identity could not take hold except at the expense of the country’s indigenous inhabitants. This didn’t make the outcome less democratic or just, but it also does not mean that the original crime was not a crime. Moreover, the question of whether America’s identity should give priority to political union based on the assertion of equality in the Declaration of Independence, or to the Constitution’s protection of the rights of states, could not be peacefully resolved through democratic processes.

Clientelism appears when democracy arrives before a modern state has had time to consolidate into an autonomous institution with its own supporting political coalition. Clientelism is an efficient form of political mobilization in societies with low levels of income and education, and is therefore best understood as an early form of democracy. In the United States, Greece, and Italy, the franchise was expanded prior to the creation of a modern state: in the 1830s in the United States, from 1844 to 1864 in Greece, and in the period after 1946 in Italy.

Self-interest explains only part of the reason that different social groups push for change, and it does not capture the high degree of moralism that often accompanies such movements. In each of these countries, individual leaders of reform movements were motivated by personal religiosity. They included the Great Elector and Frederick William I of Prussia, whose Calvinism induced them to import coreligionists from abroad and gave them a disciplinary vision of an austere and moral society led by an upright state. Calvinism also infused the Dutch state, which had accumulated extraordinary wealth and power in the seventeenth century after winning its independence from Catholic Spain.5 From well before the English Civil War, Puritanism was an important driver of reform in England, and it continued to shape the behavior of the new middle classes in the nineteenth century. This was true as well of the upper-crust Progressive Era reformers in late-nineteenth-century America, who did not think merely that political bosses and patronage politics got in the way of making money. They were morally outraged that public offices were being perverted for private ends. While Americans may distrust state authority, they also believe that their democratic government is deeply legitimate, and that manipulation of the democratic process by monied interests and corrupt politicians is a strike against the democratic principle itself.

Whereas Nigeria used to export substantial amounts of cocoa, groundnuts, palm oil, and rubber in pre-oil days, it came to be almost completely dependent on oil exports for both export earnings and government revenues.3 As a major energy producer, Indonesia faced similar challenges but was much better able to promote the growth of nonoil exports and manufacturing. While Indonesia reduced energy as a proportion of exports from 75 to 22 percent between 1975 and 2003, Nigeria’s dependence increased. The paltry 4 percent of Nigerian exports not related to energy is testimony to the complete failure to create either a modern commercial agriculture industry or manufacturing sector, which would have been sustainable routes to economic development.4<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"6b2fe602-56cb-41a9-9a69-1754dfeb4c01","name":612,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  It is estimated that from the 1970s to the early 2000s Nigeria took in about $400 billion in oil revenues.5 Unlike the East Asian export-led economies, this money was not plowed back into investments in either physical or human capital (that is, education).

This was true first and foremost in Europe: the Roman Empire was centered around the Mediterranean, with North Africa being a major grain-producing region, while Britain and Scandinavia were impoverished peripheries inhabited by tribal barbarians. The Chinese Empire started in the northerly Yellow River valley and then expanded south and southwest rather than north; colder areas—Manchuria, Korea, and Japan—were significantly less developed. And in the Americas, the Aztecs and Incas, the richest civilizations, developed in tropical/subtropical Mexico and Peru. The temperate zones of both North and South America were sparsely inhabited by relatively impoverished hunter-gatherer or pastoral societies. This pattern continued after the European conquest of the western hemisphere. The Spanish located their empire in the seats of the former indigenous civilizations, while a rich slave-based planter economy grew up in the Caribbean and northeastern (that is, subtropical) Brazil.

Geography and climate were critical to early state formation. As noted in Volume 1 of this book, the first states to appear anywhere in the world arose under very specific geographical conditions. Most appeared in alluvial valleys including those of the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, the Yellow River in China, and the Valley of Mexico, where high soil fertility allowed productive agriculture and high population densities. Further, these valleys needed to be neither too small nor too large. If they were too small, like many of those in Papua New Guinea and the highlands of Southeast Asia, they could not support sufficiently large populations that were capable of dominating their regions and taking advantage of economies of scale in creating state-level institutions. On the other hand, if they were too large and open, they could not prevent slaves and other subservient people from running away from state authority. Tribal societies are egalitarian and can subsist over very large ranges of territory. States by contrast are coercive and typically need to compel the obedience of their citizens. Anthropologist Robert Carneiro argues that some degree of geographical circumscription was necessary to permit the creation of the earliest states. Archaeologist Ian Morris has noted the rise of civilizations in widely separated places sharing common environmental conditions (what he labels the “lucky latitudes”), such as those prevailing in Europe and China.9<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"7cb2b814-e96b-437a-9229-d87468ee0065","name":659,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  These geographical conditions go quite far to explain the distribution of levels of political organization around the world.

They have survived simply because it is difficult for states to project military force into such regions. The failure of an indigenous state to emerge in Papua New Guinea despite the fact that it has been inhabited by modern humans for some forty thousand years would seem to be related to the fact that there is no large open alluvial valley there that would support a correspondingly large civilization, only a seemingly endless series of small mountain valleys. Afghanistan has been a settled crossroads for thousands of years but to this day has never consolidated into a strong centralized state, despite the efforts of a long series of invaders from the Greeks to the Persians to the British, Soviets, and NATO. Mountainous terrain and Afghanistan’s being landlocked and surrounded by powerful Iran, Russia, India, and Pakistan would seem to explain this outcome.10<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"1a8c838b-9fdf-407d-ac2e-644c704701d2","name":660,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Physical geography also played a role in the presence or absence of absolutism and democracy.

In the core areas of the Spanish New World empire—Mexico and Peru—diseases affecting settlers were not a limiting factor, but well-organized local populations should have been. In contrast to the nomadic tribal societies that existed in North America, or groups like the Mapuches who resisted white settlers in Argentina and Chile, the Aztecs and Incas were organized into complex, state-level societies and projected centralized authority over tremendous distances. And yet the speed and completeness with which their power collapsed—as told by authors from William Prescott to Jared Diamond—is astonishing.9 Francisco Pizarro defeated the Inca king Atahualpa, who commanded an army of perhaps 80,000 soldiers, with 168 Spanish troops of his own, and did not suffer a single casualty.\n        <br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"48e3e97b-2e5c-4ff5-b5d1-ec8a5e102d16","name":690,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Diamond attributes this success to a number of technological factors, such as the Spanish use of horses, muskets, and steel swords, none of which were possessed by the Incas, as well as a healthy dose of tactical surprise.

Cortés established alliances with the Tlaxcala and the Totonacs and was able to attack Tenochtitlán with tens of thousands of indigenous soldiers.

Inheriting a country that was essentially bankrupt from decades of conflict and low growth, he needed economic allies. He got them by creating a banking sector in which a small number of government-connected banks could make large amounts of money. This gave the government access to resources that it could use to suppress lawlessness and provide essential political stability. This led to an extraordinary period of economic growth in which Mexico succeeded in partially catching up to both North America and more liberal emerging powers such as Argentina. Díaz did not, however, create an open or liberal economic order but rather a system we would today label crony capitalism. It was similar in certain ways to the old mercantilist system, only run by local elites rather than the Spanish Crown.22 It did nothing to empower the mass of the Mexican population either economically or politically.

It was only in 1975 that Africa’s population density reached the level that Europe enjoyed in the year 1500. While Japan had a population density of 118.2 persons per square kilometer and China 45.6 in 1900, sub-Saharan Africa’s was only 4.4.18 As noted in the first volume, while technological innovations like higher-productivity agriculture allowed populations to expand, the economist Ester Boserup and others have argued that the reverse was also true, with larger populations spurring the need for technological change by increasing demand and permitting a greater specialization. Whichever direction causality ran, the level of technological backwardness of precolonial Africa was striking: the plow had not been adopted in agriculture, which everywhere remained rain fed rather than irrigation based, and sophisticated metalworking was not developed. The latter had huge political consequences: in contrast to the Japanese, who had a long-standing metalworking tradition and could manufacture their own guns shortly after coming into contact with Europeans, the Africans remained dependent on imported firearms until well into the nineteenth century.19<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"3fc5203a-03b9-40d2-b500-be6d257f21f7","name":814,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  A second factor limiting state formation in Africa was physical geography.

Projecting military power in this fashion was of course critical to the establishment of centralized states.

The history of European colonialism includes systematic and intensive brutality against indigenous populations.3 The practice of hacking off hands and arms as warnings in Sierra Leone that so outraged Western opinion was originally practiced by the Force Publique in Leopold’s Belgian Congo: according to one account, “Soldiers in the Congo were told to account for every cartridge fired, so they hacked off and smoked the hands, feet and private parts of their victims. Body parts were presented to commanders in baskets as proof that soldiers had done their work well.”4 While the slave trade had been suppressed, the economies of colonial Africa were highly dependent on different types of coerced labor and economic extraction. Involuntary impressment was also a widespread European practice; all colonies required corvée labor of most men, including work in unbearable and unhealthy conditions that led to the deaths of thousands. Many thousands more were drafted into European armies for service and often died on battlefields very far from home. The British, in prosecuting the Hut tax war in Sierra Leone, hanged ninety-six tribal chiefs whom they blamed for the insurrection.5 European colonial officials often behaved like petty tyrants, dispensing justice (or injustice) arbitrarily with few checks on their power. Consider the following vignette from German-controlled Cameroon, where the “imperial chancellor of the protectorate, Leist, had the wives of Dahomey soldiers whipped in the presence of their husbands, which resulted in December 1893 in a revolt of the soldiers. He had female convicts brought to him from the prison at night for his sexual gratification. He was brought before a disciplinary council and condemned to be transferred to an equivalent post, with a loss of seniority, for ‘an error in the cause of duty.’”6 Indeed, an entire academic discipline devoted to exposing the horrors of European colonialism emerged in the late twentieth century, which sought to explain how contemporary Africa’s many problems are rooted in the colonial experience.

Indeed, following the belief that “every African belonged to a tribe,” the colonial authorities created tribes where none existed, “working through a mishmash of ethnic affiliations to create ‘purer’ and clearer tribal identities as the basis for tribal authorities.”13<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"c406dc75-7e6c-4ac1-86ff-4a37e099e648","name":840,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  This “invention of tradition,” in Terence Ranger’s words, was based on a profound misunderstanding of African society:<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"bdcd0d89-cfd2-4a01-8c24-c934e1d6e19f","name":841,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  In comparing European neo-traditions with the customary in Africa the whites were certainly comparing unlike with unlike.

The British had two long-term economic policy objectives that indirect rule was meant to serve. First, they sought to convert customary land tenure into modern property rights, at the behest of both commercial agricultural interests and white settlers. Modern property rights are formal, freely alienable, and held by individuals or by legal entities operating as individuals. As elaborated in Volume 1, customary land tenure is a complex informal system of private property rights, sometimes mistakenly said to be communal in the sense of a Communist collective farm. Traditional customary property is intimately connected with the kinship system and heavily entailed by kin obligations; individuals usually are not free to alienate their holdings.15 The chief in particular does not have any right to alienate land. While customary property in this sense once existed in barbarian Europe, the feudal property rights that prevailed in the European Middle Ages were more modern in the sense of being formal, contractual, and individual. Moving from a customary to a modern land tenure system was therefore much more revolutionary than the shift from feudal to modern land tenure in Europe; it involved huge changes within the authority structure of the kin groups involved. When colonial authorities sought to buy land from customary owners, they found no one actually in charge who had the authority to alienate property. One reason to create a subordinate tribal chief under indirect rule was to empower an African equivalent of a European feudal lord who had the authority to alienate communal property into a modern property rights system.16<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"48d0d3e2-59fc-4bc9-8dc9-cb4c377f22fa","name":844,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  A second reason for empowering indigenous chiefs was to serve as tax collectors. All colonial governments established poll or capitation taxes on each male in the colony to raise revenues so that the colony could pay for its own administration. But they served another purpose as well: by making subjects pay a tax in cash, they were encouraged to move out of the bush and into the cash economy where they could serve as a labor force for European commercial agriculture. The chief function of the new native authorities thus came to be tax collection, which they could enforce much more effectively when given modern weapons and backed by threats of coercion from colonial armies. The Europeans were thus imposing their own models of political authority on societies organized very differently.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"0ee63b49-a815-43f1-9496-401be4ad1cfc","name":845,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Mamdani argues that the new chiefs were as a consequence far more despotic than true traditional authorities.

Thus while central colonial governments may have seemed extremely weak, they set up a far more dictatorial system on a local level, one that was freed of the checks and balances that existed in truly traditional African societies. They also established a bright line between citizens and subjects: the first were white settlers (and occasionally mixed-race or Asian populations) who were given access to modern legal systems, with their attendant rights and privileges, while the latter were subject to invented customary law. Legal pluralism masked the fact that the rights of white settlers would be protected much more carefully than those of black Africans. And Africans were never given leave to truly apply their own law as they wished. Customary law had to be in accord with European morals, which barred certain practices as repugnant (suttee, the burning of widows in India, was perhaps the most famous case of this). The ultimate expression of this double standard would be the apartheid regime in South Africa.18<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"5597bb84-f012-4fbe-98d5-70e5ae8585b5","name":847,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  The views of Ranger, Mamdani, and others on the malign effects of indirect rule and invented tradition have been sharply debated. Thomas Spear argues that the ability of European officials to manipulate African society—in effect, creating dictators, tribes, ethnic identities, and the like where none existed before—has been greatly exaggerated. New traditions, in order to be accepted, had to be based on something actually already existing in the culture. Nor did they simply freeze things in time; there was a constant process of adaptation between rulers and ruled that generated “unresolvable debates over the interpretation of tradition and its meaning for colonial governance and economic activity.” While some new tribal chiefs acted like dictators, others tried to soften European demands, faking tax rolls or shielding individuals from colonial justice. In order to exercise authority, local agents had to seek legitimacy, which generally means trying to incorporate the interests and wishes of the ruled. It was not just chiefs but also interpreters and personal aides who mediated between the white district officer and local populations. Social-engineering efforts that sought to combine, move, or separate different tribes often failed. Far from manipulating African societies, it was the Europeans who were often manipulated by Africans. Administrators seeking to understand “customary” rules were told stories that benefited particular African power holders or interests, and they were too naïve or ignorant to know better. In the words of Karen Fields, “Indirect rule was a way of making the colonial state a consumer of power generated within the customary order.

Following a model developed in French Algeria, independent polities in sub-Saharan Africa were progressively attacked and subdued. Large areas, including French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, were broken down into smaller “cercles,” which were in turn divided into cantons and villages. The shift from the Second Empire to the Third Republic in 1870 did not change things all that much. If anything, the French republican tradition was stricter in its desire to impose uniform rules. The stated goal was “assimilation” of the colonies into the French system.

British administration tended to reward the specialists, while the French model encouraged generalists.

In France, recruits came from the bourgeoisie, which in contrast to their British peers had disdain for local chiefs as feudal or monarchical survivals. As a consequence, the colonial service found itself unable to attract sufficient numbers of quality candidates. There are numerous anecdotes about the character of those who went to the colonies. According to one doctor, “Power-crazy psychopaths are particularly numerous in the colonies—far more so, proportionately, than in France. They belong to a large class of unbalanced individuals who seek out colonial life; their psychic make-up is particularly attracted by the exotic.” As the director of the École Coloniale said in 1929, “When a young man left for the colonies, his friends asked themselves, ‘What crime must he have committed? From what corpse is he fleeing?’” The pathological Mr. Kurtz in Joseph Conrad’s Heart of     Darkness was based in the end on some reality. All of this began to change in the 1930s as the French improved the education and professionalism of their officials, while better health conditions encouraged them to serve tours accompanied by their families.

The discipline of anthropology, having started out as a tool of European colonialism, became a powerful voice arguing for the equal dignity of indigenous cultures.27 In the words of one French Jesuit, “Custom belongs to the community itself, but to remove from the community the right of interpretation and of transformation is an act of violence more serious, though less visible, than the confiscation of arable land or of forest.”28 The French presence on the ground, just as thin as that of the other colonial powers, had in any event failed to implant powerful French-style institutions in any of the colonies.

Institutions are often complementary: you can’t build a steel plant in a country in which there is no market for steel, no supply of competent managers or workers, no infrastructure to move product to market, and no legal system to protect the rights of the plant’s investors. Strategies seeking to prioritize some goals over others require intimate understanding of the nature of local institutions. Moreover, institutions evolve based on the interests and ideas of local elites and power holders. Outsiders often don’t understand who these elites are, how they interpret their interests, and therefore what resistance they will pose to well-meaning plans for reform or change.5<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"b4fa07ec-28f6-4cab-b52d-b7b9b93839ca","name":876,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  In light of these considerations, a number of observers have suggested that the international community ought to dramatically scale back its ambitions and go for “good enough” governance, seeking to get not to Denmark but to some more realistic objective, like Indonesia or Botswana.6 Rather than importing entire modern legal codes from the United States or Europe, why not try in some circumstances to rely on customary law?

Finally, there were middle-class liberals who adopted Western ideas of freedom and democracy. This group formed the Popular Rights Movement and established a Jiyūtō (Liberal Party). They circulated petitions and organized protests, and faced repression by the Meiji regime, which led some members to turn to assassinations and armed resistance.

There were large landlords who survived until the American-imposed land reform of the late 1940s, forming part of the conservative parties’ political base.

In China, these groups had their counterparts, but they were initially weaker, and the strong state acted to keep them that way. Thus there was a Chinese aristocracy, but it did not exercise territorial sovereignty to the extent of its European counterpart; religions like Buddhism and Daoism were kept under strict control; and cities resembled the administrative centers of Europe east of the Elbe rather than the self-governing independent metropolises of Western Europe.

China may have had several of these pieces in place; what it lacked might be called the “systems integration” capacity that could pull all of them together at the same time.

The Confucians argued that reliance on written law, or fa, was detrimental because formal rules were too broad and general to produce good outcomes in specific cases.

The first was the shift from the old Qing Code’s schedules of proscriptions and punishments to a system recognizing the rights and responsibilities of citizens. For the first time, Chinese citizens were seen not simply as the subjects of state power but as individuals with positive legal entitlements. The second shift was economic. The old Qing Code had embedded property rights in the lineage or patrilineal kin group, and the right to alienate property was severely entailed by the obligations of one family member to another. The KMT code, by contrast, recognized property rights that were individual and freely alienable. It put into effect a whole domain of private law involving contract and torts, which had been regarded as “minor matters” in Qing law.

They squared this circle by creating a set of usufructuary (usage) rights that could be bought, sold, mortgaged, or transferred, in which the state nonetheless retained formal ownership. Thus, in China’s booming real estate market, no one technically “owns” an apartment or house. One owns the equivalent of a lease whose term extends up to seventy years, which is acquired in exchange for land-use fees.27 Laws regulating contracts similarly try to square individual rights with ultimate state power.

This seemingly minor point is in fact important in distinguishing Chinese and Western legal concepts: the latter see natural persons as bearers of rights and duties independently of any action of the state, whereas in China citizenship is something conferred on individuals by the state.29 Contemporary Chinese law thus continues the traditional Qing practice of not recognizing a separate sphere of individual rights bearers, and of seeing property rights as something benevolently granted to individuals by the state.30 In practice, the state could at any moment legally take that property for its own purposes. The state has at times tried to promote a rule of law as a means of dampening discontent.

Oftentimes the central government in Chang’an, Luoyang, Kaifeng, or Beijing had no idea what was going on in other parts of the country and would issue orders only to find months or years later that they had not been implemented. The post-Mao leadership early on recognized the importance of delegation. While China remains a unitary rather than a federal state, provinces and cities have been delegated substantial powers to implement directives from the center in ways that they see fit. Thus there is considerable variation in policies across China’s different regions. Southern provinces like Guangdong and cities like Shenzhen are far more market-friendly than is, say, Beijing.

This ministry is a gigantic organization, presiding over some fifty-seven thousand miles of track and employing 2.5 million people across China.17 The central government has been trying, without success, to get control of the money-losing ministry for many years. Following the highly publicized crash of a new high-speed rail train near Wenzhou in mid-2011, the ministry tried to hide evidence of malfeasance by burying the cars involved, until discussions on China’s microblogs forced it to unbury them. The central government used this as an opportunity to sack railway minister Liu Zhijun on charges of corruption, and announced that it intended to break the agency apart into two separate organizations.

There continues to be a great deal of patronage, nepotism, factionalism, political influence, and outright corruption pervading the Chinese political system. Minxin Pei argues that China’s gradual political transition has resulted in a system of “decentralized predation,” in which locally empowered officials throughout an enormous government system take advantage of the opportunities provided by their political control to extract a host of rents and bribes. Higher levels of the party understand that pervasive corruption is strongly resented by ordinary people and that the legitimacy of the party’s continued rule depends heavily on its ability to control itself.

The Spanish Crown initially tried to create a strong form of absolutist direct rule in the Americas, but the realities of distance meant that it was able to exert substantially less authority over its colonies than it could at home. The Spanish form of absolutism was a weak one, unable to tax adequately or meet its own revenue needs in Europe, and even less able to do so with respect to its restive Creole colonists in the New World. The Creoles thus created for themselves oligarchic governments based on privileges rather than liberties, which survived the transition to independent states when the colonies broke away from Spain in the early nineteenth century.

Both were dominated by autocratic regimes and economic oligarchies that used political power to protect their privileges. Yet in the succeeding two centuries, Europe underwent a profound series of political changes that left it much more democratic and economically equal than Latin America. One of the principal reasons for this was the extraordinarily high level of violence experienced by Europe during this period, beginning with the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, continuing through the wars of Italian and German unification, and ending with the cataclysms of the two world wars. High levels of military competition led to the formation and consolidation of strong, modern states, as in the Stein-Hardenberg reforms in Prussia. At the same time, rapid industrialization was drawing millions of peasants off the countryside and into dense, diverse cities. This shift created the conditions for the emergence of modern ethnolinguistic concepts of national identity, which in turn provoked further military competition. Nationalism helped to facilitate the consolidation of modern states. And both internal revolution and external war succeeded in wiping out entire social classes, like France’s venal officeholders and the Junker class in Germany, which had been pillars of the old oligarchic order.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"c462dddc-1792-46e1-95b8-f8876a87c057","name":1085,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Latin America’s development path was very different.

By 1945, Europe’s exhausted elites were ready to concede both liberal democracy and redistributive welfare states to ensure social peace. While Latin America’s elites faced the threat of social upheaval, especially after the Cuban Revolution, it was never severe enough to promote either state building or redistribution on a European scale. There was no European-style social consensus built around moderate center-left and center-right parties, but rather sharp polarizations between rich and poor.

Unlike in Latin America, early European colonialists did not find either large populations or substantial mineral resources to exploit in Africa. Tropical diseases and climate, moreover, made the region inhospitable to extensive European settlement, except for more temperate regions in the south. There simply weren’t the time or resources to build institutions before demands for independence arose in the middle decades of the twentieth century. The fact that the African colonies could barely be made to pay for the costs of their own administration led the Europeans to seek a cheap way out through “indirect rule,” using local African agents to extract taxes or force young men into corvée labor.

Low-capacity states were thus stuffed with patronage employees, vastly increasing their size and further weakening their ability to deliver real services.

This bit of conventional wisdom is misleading insofar as it implies that a more intelligent form of boundary drawing would have led to more coherent postindependence states. This is true only to a limited extent: Sudan, for example, could have been spared two long and costly civil conflicts if South Sudan and Darfur had not been attached to the Arab core around Khartoum by the British. But for much of the rest of Africa, ethnic groups were far too small and intermingled to become the basis for a modern European-style nation-state. In contrast to East Asia and Europe, strong indigenous state-level units had not performed the hard and violent work of identity formation prior to European colonization. To the extent that the colonial powers shaped identity, it was replacing tribalism with ethnicity—that is, replacing small-scale kin groups with much larger ones, done for the sake of divide-and-rule. The colonial rulers of Africa had neither the time nor the incentive to create strong states that could help shape national identity, and most of the elites that emerged after independence did not make nation building a priority. Weakness of national identity in sub-Saharan Africa is thus far more a matter of omission rather than commission. Tanzania is the exception that proves the rule.

The Chinese created a state that was centralized, bureaucratic, and impersonal, ruling a vast territory with far greater uniformity than its Roman counterpart.

Nonetheless, China and surrounding countries like Japan, Korea, and Vietnam developed governments based on the strong-state model and succeeded in reaching levels of political organization substantially higher than any of the indigenous societies of Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.

He noted that the idea of human equality that underlies modern democracy had been gaining ground for the preceding eight hundred years, and it had acquired an unstoppable momentum that aroused in him a “kind of religious dread.” He regarded its progress as a providential fact.2 Other authors have agreed that ideas were critical and have traced them to specific historical and cultural roots, either in ancient Athens or in Christianity. Both Hegel and Nietzsche understood modern political democracy to be a secularized version of the Christian doctrine of the universal equality of human dignity. Hegel in particular saw developments in the material world such as the French Revolution and the emergence of the principle of equal recognition as the working out of the inner logic of human rationality. During the Third Wave itself, as well as during the more recent Arab Spring, ideas clearly propagated rapidly across international borders via radio, television, the Internet, and flows of activists bringing news of political upheavals elsewhere.

Each of these three classes wanted a different political outcome: the traditional landowning class wanted to preserve the old authoritarian order; the bourgeoisie wanted a liberal (i.e., rule of law) regime protecting their property rights that might or might not include formal electoral democracy (they were always more interested in the rule of law than in democracy); and the proletariat, once it achieved consciousness of itself as a class, wanted a dictatorship of the proletariat, which would in turn socialize the means of production, abolish private property, and redistribute wealth.

He is probably best remembered for his blunt observation: “No bourgeoisie, no democracy.” By this he did not mean that the rise of the bourgeoisie inevitably produced democracy. In Germany, for example, the industrial bourgeoisie allied itself with the autocratic Junker landowning aristocracy in the famous marriage of “iron and rye” that upheld Bismarckian authoritarianism, and later played some role in the rise of Hitler. Rather, Moore argued that democracy could emerge if a rapidly enlarging bourgeoisie succeeded in displacing the older order of landowners and peasants. This happened in England, he noted, as an entrepreneurial bourgeoisie in the countryside succeeded in commercializing agriculture, driving peasants off the land, and using the proceeds to fund the Industrial Revolution.

Lenin and Mao came to power on the backs of peasants, despite the fact that Marx believed they were a class destined ultimately to disappear. Moore, taking these cases into account, argued that democratization faced special obstacles under conditions of what he called “labor-repressive” agriculture, in which peasants were tied to the land in large, concentrated estates. The result was the survival of an authoritarian landowning class, which in turn spawned worker-peasant revolutionary movements.

He began with the classic Whig argument that “the assembly which votes the taxes, either general or local, should be elected exclusively by those who pay something towards the taxes imposed.”6 The idea that only taxpayers should vote was the flip side of the principle “no taxation without representation” that was the motto of both the English and American Revolutions. Mill therefore believed it was better to impose direct rather than indirect taxes, since that would remind citizens of their obligations to be vigilant about how the government spent their money.

In an argument that sounds particularly foreign to contemporary ears, he noted that “if it is asserted that all persons ought to be equal in every description of right recognised by society, I answer, not until all are equal in worth as human beings.”7 This led to a conclusion that different classes of people should have different numbers of votes based on their level of education: an unskilled laborer, one vote; a foreman, three; and a lawyer, physician, or clergyman, five or six. He noted that Louis Napoleon had just been elected president of France by millions of “peasants who could neither read nor write, and whose knowledge of public men, even by name, was limited to oral tradition.”8 Very similar arguments would be used by whites in the American South to restrict or take away voting rights from African Americans in the decades following the Civil War as Jim Crow laws spread.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"75c19662-9408-4ddc-84df-04053f8483fe","name":1150,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Other thinkers made the argument that only elites were capable of objective guardianship of the public interest and should therefore be trusted to represent those who did not have the right to vote.

Ideas and norms shaped material interests: the British landed upper classes were far more ready to let their daughters marry wealthy up-and-coming commoners than were their Prussian Junker counterparts, and much more willing to be persuaded by Whiggish notions that the spread of education and literacy would make it safe to permit their working-class countrymen the right to vote.23<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"1b63b114-edf9-4d2d-b146-bc80ccbfa1ac","name":1168,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Unfortunately, the story of democratization in most of Europe did not end with gradual and peaceful franchise extensions.

It occurs primarily in modernizing countries, where the narrow old forms of identity based on kinship and locality disappear and are replaced by more universalist doctrines linking individuals to broader cultural movements. He argued that the rise of modern Islamism responded to very similar imperatives in the Middle East, where religion plays the role that nation played in Europe. To the confused former peasant now living in Cairo or Karachi, or to a second-generation Muslim immigrant in Europe, a figure like Osama bin Laden can provide a convincing answer to the question “Who am I?” The rise of political Islam in the last part of the twentieth century does not therefore reflect the return of an eternally unchanging Islam, as both the proponents of radical Islam and their critics maintain, but rather is a response precisely to the half-modernized state in which much of the Middle East finds itself.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"08769012-fe88-4a90-a46a-4a279e3725ea","name":1194,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  So just as the nineteenth-century European impulse toward democracy got diverted into nationalism, so the Middle Eastern popular mobilization risks being hijacked by religion.5<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"3d3d84c7-30c4-46d8-83f5-0a368ee94a12","name":1195,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  The Third Wave transitions in Eastern Europe and Latin America are thus misleading precedents for the Arab Spring.

A typical way is simply to choose some band like the middle three quintiles of the income distribution, or to count those individuals who fall within 0.5 to 1.5 times the median income. This makes the definition of middle class dependent on a society’s average wealth and thus incomparable cross-nationally; being middle class in Brazil means a much lower consumption level than in the United States. To avoid this problem, some economists choose an absolute level of consumption, ranging from a low of US$5 a day, or $1,800 in parity purchasing power per year, up to a range of $6,000–$31,000 annual income in 2010 U.S. dollars.

But the laws of physics do not guarantee such a result. It is entirely possible that the first 150 years of the Industrial Revolution captured what Tyler Cowen calls the “low-hanging fruit” of productivity advance, and that while future innovations will continue, the rate at which they improve human welfare will fall.

(Lodgepole pines in fact require fires to propagate their seeds.) Over the years, these forests developed high tree densities and huge buildups of dry understory, such that fires that did occur became much larger and more destructive. Instead of destroying the small invasive species, these fires now burned the larger old-growth trees. The public began to take notice after the huge Yellowstone fire in 1988, which ended up burning nearly eight hundred thousand acres and took several months to control.

This original mandate was greatly diminished in scope: in the last decade of the twentieth century, timber harvests in national forests plunged from twelve to four billion board-feet per year.6 The reason for this had partly to do with the economics of timber, but it more importantly reflected a change in national values that had taken place over the previous century. With the rise of environmental consciousness, natural forests were increasingly seen not as resources to be exploited for economic purposes but as preserves to be protected for their own sake. This shift was of a piece with many other changes in social attitudes taking place at the time. Dams and other big hydroelectric projects, earlier seen as heroic efforts to master nature, were later understood to entail huge unintended environmental consequences. In North America, dams had virtually ceased being built by the 1970s. The change in the Forest Service’s mission was written into law when President Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 Wilderness Act, which enjoined the Forest Service along with the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to review and protect the more than nine million acres of land under their control.7<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"ecdc75d6-9f00-4da0-824e-cfa601a8f7b1","name":1256,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Even in its original core mission of sustainably harvesting timber, a number of critics noted that the Forest Service was not doing a good job.

This came about not through old-style corruption typified by the Ballinger affair in 1908 that led to Pinchot’s firing by President Taft; rather, it worked through the issuing of legislative mandates that forced the Forest Service to pursue differing and often contradictory goals. For example, the protection of the properties of the increasing number of homeowners living at the wildland-urban interface meant that the “let burn” policy desired by environmentalists could not be implemented in any straightforward way.

In other cases, interest groups have been able to block legislation harmful to their interests. The simplest and most effective response to the financial crisis of 2008–2009 and the hugely unpopular taxpayer bailouts of large banks would have been a law that put a hard cap on the size of financial institutions, or else dramatically raised capital requirements that would have had much the same effect.7 If such constraints existed, banks taking foolish risks could go bankrupt without triggering a systemic crisis and government bailout. Like the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, such a law could have been written on a few of sheets of paper. But this possibility was not seriously considered during the congressional deliberations on financial regulation. What emerged instead was the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection, or Dodd-Frank, Act, which, while better than no regulation at all, extended to hundreds of pages of legislation and mandated reams of further detailed rules that will impose huge costs on banks and consumers down the road. Rather than simply capping bank size, it creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council tasked with the enormous job of assessing and managing institutions deemed to pose systemic risks, which in the end will still not solve the problem of banks being too big to fail. Though no one will ever find a smoking gun linking bank campaign contributions to the votes of specific congressmen, it defies belief that the banking industry’s legions of lobbyists did not have a major impact in preventing the simpler solution of simply breaking up the big banks or subjecting them to stringent capital requirements.8<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"}]},{"idx":"44c710f6-f02f-4da2-bc1b-929b74c2ef5d","name":"PASSIONS AND INTERESTS","children":[{"idx":"e1550905-ebdf-4d68-a8eb-2cd7664e0c14","name":1319,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Ordinary Americans express widespread disdain for interest groups and their sway over Congress.

These rents were unproductive in the aggregate and costly to the public as a whole. But the general public had a collective action problem or could not organize as effectively as, for example, the banking industry and corn producers to protect their interests.

His earlier work, The Logic of Collective Action, in fact explained that it is much more difficult to organize large as opposed to small groups, since large groups that provide benefits to all their members invite free riding. In a democratic context, the whole body of citizens (or at least large majorities within them) may share a long-term interest in, for example, a fiscally responsible budget, but any one American feels this much less powerfully than an interest group that would get its subsidy or tax break cut as the result of a budget consolidation. The interest groups that contend for the attention of Congress are therefore not collectively representative of the whole American people. They are representative of the best-organized and (what often amounts to the same thing) richly endowed parts of American society.

The Constitution also establishes a judicial branch that over time acquired the power to invalidate legislation coming from Congress. It further distributes powers to the states—or rather, the states, which were the original holders of power, gave up authority to a federal government only slowly and grudgingly in the course of the two hundred years following ratification of the Constitution. Congress itself is divided into two houses, the upper one originally designed to be a bastion of state power. In many democratic systems like that of Britain, the upper house has largely ceremonial powers; in the United States, it is very strong and exercises specific powers such as confirmation of executive appointments and authority over war and peace.

In Britain, citizens have one large, formal check on government—their ability to periodically elect Parliament. (There is another important check, a free media, which is not part of the formal political system.) In all other respects, however, the system concentrates rather than diffuses power. A pure Westminster system has only a single all-powerful legislative chamber, no separate presidency, no written constitution and therefore no judicial review, and no federalism or constitutionally mandated devolution of powers to localities. It has a plurality, or first-past-the-post, voting system, which tends to produce a two-party system and strong parliamentary majorities even when the majority party wins only a plurality of the vote.8 Critical to the functioning of this system is party discipline; the leadership of the Conservative or Labour Party can force its members of Parliament to vote according to their wishes because they can deny recalcitrant MPs the ability to run for office in the next election. The British equivalent of the cloture rule needs only a simple majority of MPs present to force a vote; American-style filibustering is not possible. The parliamentary majority then chooses a government with strong executive powers, and when it makes a legislative decision, it generally cannot be stymied by courts, states, municipalities, or other bodies.

Congress needs to delegate authority, but it does not want to give up control. Thus, although the Constitution clearly delegates to the executive branch authority over national defense and foreign relations, this does not prevent Congress from constantly dragging secretaries of defense and state before it, mandating detailed rules regarding, for example, embassy security, and requiring them to produce hundreds of annual reports on subjects from environmental damage to human rights. Distrust of presidential authority has led to the peculiar independent commission structure that characterized the Interstate Commerce Commission and other regulators. Instead of straightforwardly delegating power to a single agency head who is then accountable to the president, early regulatory agencies reported instead to a group of commissioners balanced between the two parties. Congress was in effect delegating control to the executive while at the same time strictly controlling that delegation. An election that in a European parliamentary system would lead to a swift change in policy slows down in the United States as commissioners cycle through their fixed terms.

Finally, independent legal systems evolved in ancient Israel, the Christian West, India, and the Muslim world in the form of religious law administered by a hierarchy of priests, who had at least nominal authority over secular rulers. The content of these laws varied considerably from culture to culture, as did the degree and nature of institutionalization.

Laws regulated family life, inheritance, and property, and provided for dispute resolution in a sphere somewhat protected from the state.

Since the division of labor is much less extensive when there is no vigorous development of a capitalist industrial sector, different types of social groups emerge compared to nineteenth-century Europe. There is neither a large emerging group of middle-class individuals, professionals with higher levels of education, nor a strong industrial proletariat. Rather, such societies have a large, amorphous group of urbanized poor who eke out livings in the informal sector. Many of these people can be highly entrepreneurial when given access to capital and markets. The contemporary microfinance industry and property rights movements are built around providing the poor with such tools.3 But there is no clear path from informal employment to true growth- and job-generating industrialization. Clientelism thrives under these conditions, since the individualized benefits offered by politicians, and the ability to generate rents in the public sector, are often a much more effective path to economic security than the private sector.

In Britain it was middle classes wanting to break into the circle of privilege held by the old aristocracy.

The country’s Westminster system concentrated power in such a way that the reform could be put in place in less than two decades. In the United States, the reform coalition was more complex. The new middle and professional classes were themselves divided on the issue of patronage, with some business interests having found a way to work within the old system.

There is a similar argument to be made for the intrinsic value of market-based economic systems. Amartya Sen notes that the latter are not simply more efficient; even if a planned economy grew at an equal rate, a citizen “may still have very good reason to prefer the scenario of free choice over that of submission to order.”4 The exercise of political and economic agency is an important end of human life itself, apart from the effects of that exercise.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"eb8a72a5-c4b7-4242-9f4a-5af56b6db5b8","name":1494,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  The rule of law that grants rights to citizens also has an intrinsic value independent of whether those rights are useful in promoting economic growth.

A rule of law that protects individual rights in effect recognizes that citizens are adults who are capable of independent moral choice.
