This study, however, was limited by its assessment of depression. All patients using antidepressant drugs were considered to be suffering from depression, although a large proportion of antidepressants are prescribed for reasons other than depression. In addition, less than 30% of patients having depression are treated with antidepressant drugs [16 Olfson M. Marcus S.C. National patterns in antidepressant medication treatment.

The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed a greater likelihood of discontinuation of AD treatment in patients with depression compared with patients with diabetes alone with a crude HR of 1.63 (CI 1.52–1.75) and an adjusted HR of 1.52 (CI 1.41–1.63).

This finding might be due to a lower number of side effects for metformin, the first-line choice in diabetes management [2 Harper W. Clement M. Goldenberg R. et al.

Initiating AD treatment with a combination of oral ADs and insulin was associated with a higher likelihood of nonpersistence. We, however, did not observe the same result for combinations without insulin, suggesting that starting treatment with insulin could negatively influence persistence with any AD. Drawing up insulin and treatment complexity, in general, are known barriers to adherence with AD treatment [32 de Vries S.T. Keers J.C. Visser R. et al.

Starting AD treatment with a combination of drugs that includes insulin might also indicate that those patients had severe hyperglycemia at diagnosis and required intensive treatment because this regimen is recommended by clinical guidelines. These patients could have possibly consulted a physician late because they are less careful about their health and less adherent to lifestyle recommendations.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"1dd093a6-6170-4def-99e7-987dc783d612","level":"paragraphid","name":32,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  This study has several strengths. First, by using the RAMQ databases and the hospitalization registry, we were able to build a large cohort of subjects treated for diabetes in the province of Quebec for up to 9 years of follow-up. In addition, we measured persistence using drug claims, avoiding recall biases typical of surveys based on self-report information. Furthermore, in our study, we took into account AD treatment switches over time, which might be due to a proper therapeutic management, and followed patients even if they switched from an oral AD to another oral AD or to insulin.This approach, rather than studying persistence with the initial AD treatment, gives a better representation of real-life practices, in which treatment switches are common, concerning approximately 10% of patients in the first year [34 Boccuzzi S.J. Wogen J. Fox J. et al. Utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents in a drug-insured U.S. population.Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 1411-1415 Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar ]. In addition, this study could be considered population-based for patients 65 years and older because in the province of Quebec, almost all these patients are enrolled in the public drug plan. Finally, we used a time-dependent analysis, which provided us a more reliable assessment of the risk of nonpersistence with AD treatment after depression, avoiding immortal time bias [22 Suissa S. Immortal time bias in pharmaco-epidemiology. Am J Epidemiol. 2008; 167: 492-499 Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar ].<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"1b1d17fa-ee38-4f67-9207-0d0afd01f5e0","level":"paragraphid","name":33,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Our study, as with any claim-based study, also has some limitations. We used an algorithm based on administrative databases, rather than a structured interview, to assess the presence of depression. This approach could have led to an underestimation of depression cases because the algorithm sensitivity is 78% [ 21 Alaghehbandan R. Macdonald D. Barrett B. et al. Using administrative databases in the surveillance of depressive disorders—case definitions. Popul Health Manag. 2012; 15: 372-380 Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar ], and depression is likely underdiagnosed in primary care [35 Kahn L.S. Fox C.H. McIntyre R.S. et al. Assessing the prevalence of depression among individuals with diabetes in a Medicaid managed-care program. Int J Psychiatry Med. 2008; 38: 13-29 Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar ]. This misclassification of depression cases has probably caused an underestimation of the actual risk of nonpersistence. Although we adjusted for a number of possible confounders (e.g., the number of physician visits, the number of different physicians visited, the number of different medications claimed, and the number of hospitalizations), we did not take into account any variation that might have occurred during follow-up (especially after depression diagnosis). Consequently, residual confounding could still be present because of time-varying changes in health care utilization. Furthermore, in the RAMQ databases, there is no information about patients younger than 65 years who are covered by a private drug plan. This lack of information resulted in a cohort of patients in which employed patients are under-represented with an effect on the estimated likelihood of nonpersistence difficult to assess. We also assumed that drugs claimed were actually taken, and we considered that patients following a polytherapy regimen were persistent if they claimed at least one of their ADs. This assumption could have led to an overestimation of the real persistence. Finally, the RAMQ databases do not contain information about some factors that could be associated with persistence with AD treatment, such as clinical data (e.g., glycated hemoglobin) indicating the severity of diabetes, side effects of drugs [36 Chao J. Nau D.P. Aikens J.E. Taylor S.D.

Hoffman C. Stevens A. et al.

Thus, the presence of residual confounding cannot be excluded.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"},{"idx":"52774c0a-1776-407b-b404-6f5c0022d1be","level":"paragraphid","name":34,"NodeDescription":"///t <br/>  Medication persistence is a key point in the achievement and maintenance of long-term glycemic control, which is crucial in preventing diabetes complications. Nonpersistence was extremely common in our cohort, with 43.1% of patients discontinuing their AD treatment during the follow-up. The discontinuation rates that we observed could dramatically reduce treatment efficacy and might increase diabetes complications. The results of our study demonstrate the negative association of depression on medication persistence in patients with diabetes. The higher likelihood of nonpersistence observed in patients who had a diagnosis of depression could partly explain reports showing that diabetic patients with depression have a higher risk of diabetes complications than do patients without depression. Because depression negatively influences persistence with AD treatment, it appears important to recognize diabetic patients with depression and to closely follow their AD treatment. Physicians should also pay attention more closely to depressive patients at a higher risk for nonpersistence, in particular younger users of AD, to help them better manage their treatment.<br/>   t///  <br/> ///h  <br/> h///"}]}]},{"idx":"bb90c1a9-1e65-450d-bf3c-9d8d99d3bcb5","level":"chapter","name":"7.
