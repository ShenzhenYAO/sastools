For example, physicians can influence patients’ knowledge about the disease, treatments, and other management strategies . A study found that lack of support by physicians was associated with poor adherence.(46) Furthermore, studies suggested that physicians may play an important role in enhancing medication adherence by providing simple and specific educational messages,(47) or clear instructions on therapeutic plan and strategies.(48) Another study reported that patients receiving physician counselling on disease and medication knowledge were more likely to continue with medication (OR=2.7, 1.6 to 4.8) comparing with patients not receiving counselling.(49)</p><p>Physician follow up were also related to mediation adherence.(50) Early follow up by physicians were associated with higher adherence level (OR=1.11, 1.01 to 1.22) among patients receiving statin.(51) Risk of non-adherence reduced when having higher visits with the prescribing physician (OR per 0.5 increase, 0.77 [CI, 0.70 to 0.85]).(52)</p><p>Adherence can also be influenced by the interpersonal experience between physicians and patients. Positive relationships have been strongly associated with medication adherence.(53) Simpson and colleagues reported that patient–provider relationship is a positive predictor of high levels of adherence.(54) A review on 48 studies showed that better physician-patient collaboration is associated with better patient adherence(55) . Positive relationships are particularly related to physicians’ communication skill.(56,57) A study suggested that ineffective communication were associated with patient’s poor understanding of disease, potential complications, and suboptimal medication adherence .(22) Another study showed that poor communication by physicians was associated with 19% higher risk of medication non-adherence.(58) On the contrary, training physicians in communication skills results in substantial and significant improvements in patient adherence (OR=1.62) comparing with physician receiving no training”(58)</p><p>Physicians can also impact complexity of medication regimens.(59) Avoidance of polypharmacy and multiple daily doses are associated with better adherence.

In addition, more USP related covariates were measured, including: 1) the remuneration type of the USP [i.e., fee-for-service (FFS) or non-fee-for-service (NFFS)] within each USP-user observation period (i.e., from 365 days prior to the index date through 365 days on and after the index date); 2) whether or not providing comprehensive continuity of care(i.e., the USP being the most frequently visited GP of the study patient, and providing complete medical examination for the patient).</p><p>t///</p><p><br></p>"},{"idx":"MYe871884e-5d4d-4f9b-a2e9-6bbe5d3b1958","name":"Patient related covariates","custparents":[{"idx":"MY18912ac4-4c8e-4874-88cb-88a73a464d9a"}],"NodeDescription":"<p>///t</p><p><strong>Patient-related covariates</strong></p><p>The literature suggests a five-dimension framework of factors that are potentially associated with medication adherence: patient-related, socioeconomic-related, disease-related, treatment related, and healthcare system-related factors.(16) Based on this framework, patient-related covariates (Appendix 10) were measured to adjust the effect on medication adherence by age/sex concordance.</p><p>//tt</p>"},{"idx":"MYf971bf44-212d-4d86-a567-79d57d7176b2","name":"Statistical analysis","custparents":[{"idx":"MY18912ac4-4c8e-4874-88cb-88a73a464d9a"}],"NodeDescription":"<p>///t</p><p>Logistic regression models were built to test the effect of age and sex concordance on medication adherence. The dependent variable was the status of optimal medication adherence (i.e., yes or no) of individual study patients, as measured in objective one. The primary independent variable was age concordance, or sex concordance respectively. First, univariate logistic regression models were tested for each primary independent variable. Odds ratio of age concordance and sex concordance were obtained from the univariate models. Next, multivariable models were built to test the effect of age and sex concordance in the same multivariable model adjusted by aforementioned USP-related, and patient-related covariates. Multicollinearity among the independent variables was examined by the variance inflation factor (VIF) obtained from a regression model. Variables with a VIF greater than 2.5 were excluded. Two-way interactions between the primary interested variable and the covariates were examined. Interactions with a p value &lt; 0.05 were retained in the model. As a USP appeared for multiple times, the data was clustered. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) method was used to account for the cluster effect. The IDs of the USPs were used as the repeat term in the GEE model. The GEE models were compared using different types of variance-covariance matrix. The one with the smallest statistic of quarsi Akaike information criterion (QAIC) was selected to obtain odds ratio of age concordance and sex concordance the robust estimating results. </p><p>t///</p>"}]}]}]}]}},{"idx":"MYe43680cb-d907-4acc-960c-44d7e20b15d8","name":"Analysis","custparents":[{"idx":"edd76f6a-da61-4d5b-939a-6f6cb3f079db"}],"children":[{"idx":"MY63762c5b-22b2-4ae1-b67d-e52a129f2dc5","name":"glimmix","custparents":[{"idx":"MYe43680cb-d907-4acc-960c-44d7e20b15d8"}],"NodeDescription":"<p>///t</p><p><br></p><p>F:\\Personal\\Library\\Learning\\Statistics\\MultiLevel Random mixed effect\\Glimmix Mix EG43.egp</p><p>F:\\Personal\\Dropbox\\Project\\SDP Impact\\Sharpen the saw\\Skovgaard's Lecture and examples\\Glimmix MOR example\\MOR example.egp</p><p>F:\\Personal\\Library\\Learning\\Statistics\\MultiLevel Random mixed effect</p><p><br></p><p>t///</p><p>[to do][_Q]</p>"},{"idx":"MY5fd7a565-a7d3-42f7-8c5d-87183473461a","name":"substeps","custparents":[{"idx":"MYe43680cb-d907-4acc-960c-44d7e20b15d8"}],"children":[{"idx":"MYfae9ba9b-2fb1-471c-b212-39d2ac6af248","name":"Pilot 2","custparents":[{"idx":"MY5fd7a565-a7d3-42f7-8c5d-87183473461a"}],"children":[{"idx":"MY4fa9504c-91d6-41b0-80c4-3733f4f0e598","name":"USP and Patient cohort","custparents":[{"idx":"MYfae9ba9b-2fb1-471c-b212-39d2ac6af248"}],"NodeDescription":"<p>///t</p><p>t///</p><p>USP and new statin users entered in 2016 and 2017 (USP having 6+ patients)</p><table><tbody><tr><td data-row=\"row-gonl\"><br></td><td data-row=\"row-gonl\">USPs</td><td data-row=\"row-gonl\">New statin users</td></tr><tr><td data-row=\"row-l3l7\">ZXXA1</td><td data-row=\"row-l3l7\">1345</td><td data-row=\"row-l3l7\">18932</td></tr><tr><td data-row=\"row-hm3l\">ZXXA (excluding USPs with &lt; 10 statin new users)</td><td data-row=\"row-hm3l\">603</td><td data-row=\"row-hm3l\">15960</td></tr><tr><td data-row=\"row-9k0u\">ZXXA (excluding USPs with &lt; 6 statin new users)</td><td data-row=\"row-9k0u\">828</td><td data-row=\"row-9k0u\">17643</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p>"},{"idx":"MY03b2cb13-c4cc-48ad-9464-98f5515a3a17","name":"USP characteristics","custparents":[{"idx":"MYfae9ba9b-2fb1-471c-b212-39d2ac6af248"}],"children":[{"idx":"MY7c5f29f5-93ea-49f1-b43b-41907a83cde8","name":"From Mobility file","custparents":[{"idx":"MY03b2cb13-c4cc-48ad-9464-98f5515a3a17"}]},{"idx":"MY0f4fa5c3-8d9e-4cb2-9ec2-ef58125f6055","name":"From MSB","custparents":[{"idx":"MY03b2cb13-c4cc-48ad-9464-98f5515a3a17"}]},{"idx":"MY71a86c39-6c5d-4301-b4b8-691f6b016861","name":"From Rx","custparents":[{"idx":"MY03b2cb13-c4cc-48ad-9464-98f5515a3a17"}]}],"NodeDescription":"<p>///t</p><p>t///</p><p>Adding USP charateristics (Sex, birth year, grad year, grad country code, and grad country N ( 1 for domestic in Canada, 0 for foreign)</p><table><tbody><tr><td data-row=\"row-gonl\"><br></td><td data-row=\"row-gonl\">USPs</td><td data-row=\"row-gonl\">New statin users</td></tr><tr><td data-row=\"row-9k0u\">ZXXA (excluding USPs with &lt; 6 statin new users)</td><td data-row=\"row-9k0u\">828</td><td data-row=\"row-9k0u\">17643</td></tr><tr><td data-row=\"row-3soe\">ZXXB</td><td data-row=\"row-3soe\">791</td><td data-row=\"row-3soe\">17216</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p>"},{"idx":"MYf66aa205-1d33-4570-8559-0da4055d147d","name":"PCT of Adh Patients","custparents":[{"idx":"MYfae9ba9b-2fb1-471c-b212-39d2ac6af248"}]},{"idx":"MYd9c3838d-5cf3-44a2-8051-64e2565922b2","name":"Data USPF aggregated","custparents":[{"idx":"MYfae9ba9b-2fb1-471c-b212-39d2ac6af248"}],"children":[{"idx":"MY3532a70c-0e97-4139-8f07-830c9de9be4f","name":"Logistic, Doc HiPctAdhPt as outcome, Doc Means ","custparents":[{"idx":"MYd9c3838d-5cf3-44a2-8051-64e2565922b2"}],"children":[{"idx":"MY09fb201b-04bf-4e46-9a78-6e00f83a4dd9","name":"Results","custparents":[{"idx":"MY3532a70c-0e97-4139-8f07-830c9de9be4f"}],"NodeDescription":"<p>///t</p><p>t///</p><p>Neither doc age nor doc sex were related to high % of adh patients</p><p>However, the following two are to be noted;</p><ol><li data-list=\"ordered\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span>Strong and significantly high likelihood to have high % adh patients among Canada trained USPs as opposed to foreigned trained USPs</li><li data-list=\"ordered\"><span class=\"ql-ui\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span>Weirdly, number of patients who visited the USP were reversely linked to the likelihood of having high % of adherent patients.
